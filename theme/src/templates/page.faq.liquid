              <p class="small">Yes, like most comedy clubs, we ask that each customer purchase at least two drinks (they don’t have to be alcoholic – we just want you hydrated for all the laughing you’ll be doing!). Food purchases don’t count toward the drink minimum – we still ask that you get two drinks even if you’re eating.</p>

              <p class="small">Our minimum age is 16 when accompanied by an adult. Unaccompanied, it’s 18. Generally, our shows are “R” rated – there may be profanity and discussion of “adult” topics like sex and drugs (which your kids probably know more about than you anyway – thanks internet!)</p>

              <p class="small">At most comedy clubs, food is at best an afterthought (and often as laughable as anything you’ll hear from the stage). Tribeca Comedy Lounge is different. Our kitchen is helmed by veteran New York chef Kenneth Johnson (formerly of Pescatore, Picholine and Osteria fiorella), who has created a menu of classic yet creative Italian fare guaranteed to keep your mouth happy in those rare moments when it’s not busy laughing.</p>
